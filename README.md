## Introduction
Recognition-AEB-Facial is a cutting-edge software solution for facial and object recognition. This project leverages advanced algorithms to provide accurate and efficient biometric recognition capabilities.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Identify and verify individuals based on facial features.
- **Object Recognition**: Detect and recognize various objects within images and videos.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing data in real-time for immediate results.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to ensure high accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and multiple recognition tasks simultaneously.

## Installation
To get started with Recognition-AEB-Facial, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samscloud/Recognition-AEB-Facial.git
   cd Recognition-AEB-Facial
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup Configuration: Edit the configuration file to set up your environment (e.g., database settings, API keys).

cp config.example.json config.json
nano config.json
Usage
To use the software, follow these steps:

Run the Application: To start the application, run the following command:

python main.py
Access the API: Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints. The FastAPI application will be available at http://localhost:8000 by default.

WebSocket Connection: The application supports WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint using the following URL:

ws://localhost:8000/ws/{monitor_id}
Replace {monitor_id} with the actual monitor ID.

API Endpoints:

Monitor API: /api/monitors
File Streaming: /streams
Configuration Parameters: The application utilizes various configuration parameters defined in the config.json file. Ensure you have configured the necessary settings such as database connections, API keys, and model paths.

Example Usage
Here is an example of how to use the API to get monitor information:

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/monitors"
To connect to the WebSocket endpoint and send/receive messages, you can use a WebSocket client like websocat:

websocat ws://localhost:8000/ws/<monitor_id>
Additional Parameters
Startup Event: The application initializes monitors, tracking users, and face recognition services during the startup event.
CORSMiddleware: Configured to allow all origins, methods, and headers.
Error Handling: Logs errors during startup and WebSocket connections.
Configuration
The configuration file (config.json) includes various settings that can be adjusted:

Database Settings: Configure your database connection.
API Keys: Set your API keys for third-party services.
Model Paths: Specify paths to pre-trained models.
Shinobi Settings: Configure Shinobi settings for monitor management.
